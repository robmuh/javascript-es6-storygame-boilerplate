Story Game Starter
==================

Story game is a boilerplate and basic game engine for teaching
programming by having students create a game using a modified version of
the world's first video game genre, a story game (aka text adventures,
aka interactive fiction).

Story games are great to help students create real, type-written code
immediately and promotes all the skills eventually required by
professionals.

This boilerplate comes with four starters:

1. [Web REPL]
2. [Web Console]
3. [Terminal Node JS]
4. [Terminal Python]

Most educators will start out beginners in either JavaScript or Python.
This provides a bit of variety.

However, I personally recommend the Web REPL over all the others because
it can be instantly forked and shared with students on [REPL.it] and
allows use of full HTML rich text output. You could even have a full
canvas game display as well as playing images and sound. This is
instantly more interesting to pretty much every beginner without losing
the fun and retro feel of using a terminal, which translates later into
motivation to learn real command-line skills.

JavaScript is clearly the [best first language] at this pointâ€”especially
as presented here because it immediately introduces functions as just
another type of thing that can be assigned to a constant or variable
(first-class functions). Old school functions (such as required in
Python, Java, C++ and pretty much everything else) do not convey this
essential understanding of just what first-class functions are and why
they are important.
