Story Game Starter
==================

Story game is a boilerplate for teaching programming by creating the
world's first video game genre, the interactive story game also known as
text adventures and more recently as interactive fiction.

This boilerplate comes with four starters:

1. [Web REPL]
2. [Web Console]
3. [Terminal Node JS]
4. [Terminal Python]

Most educators will start out beginners in either JavaScript or Python.
This provides a bit of variety. However, I personally recommend the Web
REPL over all the others because it can be instantly forked and shared
with students on [REPL.it] and allows use of full HTML rich text output.
You could even have a full canvas game display as well as playing images
and sound. This is instantly more interesting to pretty much every
beginner without losing the fun and retro feel of using a terminal,
which translates later into motivation to learn real command-line
skills.
