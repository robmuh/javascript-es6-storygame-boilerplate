Story Game Starter
==================

Story game is a boilerplate and basic game engine for teaching
programming by having students create a game using a modified version of
the world's first video game genre, a story game (aka text adventures,
aka interactive fiction). The easiest way to get started is to fork this
repo or the same on [REPL.it].

Story games are great to help students create real, type-written code
immediately and promotes all the skills eventually required by
professionals.

JavaScript is clearly the [best first language] at this pointâ€”especially
as presented here because it immediately introduces functions as just
another type of value that can be assigned to a constant or variable
(first-class functions) or even passed to other functions that return
functions themselves (higher-order functions). Old school functions
(such as required in Python, Java, C++ and pretty much everything else)
do not convey this essential understanding because the syntax lacks the
ability to define a new function simply by assigning an anonymous
function as a value.

TODO
----

* Add up arrow and down arrow history
* Add information flow history for `back`
* Add _.voice.name support to change voices programmatically
* Add lock that forces to wait for voice to finish before continuing
* Add a modal display window that triggers blur event to
  hide the onscreen keyboard (`show()`)
